# Network protocol notes

## TCP 
TCP is a reliable network communication protocol, it favours giving accurate packets over speed. This is in contrast to UDP which favours speed with its datagram transport without retransmission of dropped packets.

##### Notes
BSD Sockets is an API to the transport layer of the Internet Protocol Stack. It supports creating both TCP and UDP network I/O.
